# LCD1602 Go Library

Yet another Go library for controlling LCD1602 displays via I2C in 4-bit mode.

It is more descriptive in code, and do not rely on external libs.

## Demo

Run the included demo to see the library in action:

```bash
go run main.go
```

This initializes the LCD, displays a cat ASCII art, and updates the current time every second.
